# Todo

- [x] When simply running dictionary.py with no tags, it should use the pyperclip module to take the copied word (clipboard)  and run the script on it
- [x] Save the vocab.csv to /home/waveandsmile always, right now if I run from a different location/directory it creates a new 
   vocab.csv in that directory instead of adding that word to the vocab.csv at home directory
- [x] When in revision mode, if you click enter for a meaning of word (means you know it) it still shows the meaning for like 10-20 secs
  just for the user to confirm that what he remembered/believed the definition was is actually same as what the meaning really is 

- [x] optimize it so that if user enters a wrong word  it shows us the best possible word nearest to it
- [x] add functionality to save the things displayed in a excel file or a text file for easy record 
- [x] add functionality to have a vocabulary tester which will ask you the meanings of word you looked up before.. 
- [x] Add Colored text for definitions in python

- [ ] In revision mode, while displaying random words, a word must not come more than 3 times
